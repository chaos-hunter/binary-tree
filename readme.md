For question 1: For this question it implements a Binary Tree to parse and evaluate fully parenthesized arithmetic expressions with operators, constants, and variables from the terminal. It displays the expression in 3 forms preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals and calculates the expression inputed, after prompting for variable values. The program also handles errors like division by zero by displaying an error message or by resulting in the answer being zero.
testing the program:
to compile: make a3q1
to execute: ./a3q1 '((x1+5.12)*(x2-7.68))/x3'(expression)
then the menu will pop up
restart: make clean
